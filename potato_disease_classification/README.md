# 🥔 Potato Disease Prediction
This project focuses on building an intelligent system to detect and classify potato leaf diseases using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Early identification of plant diseases is crucial for improving crop yield, reducing losses, and supporting sustainable agriculture.

🔍 Features
- Image-based detection: Uses potato leaf images to identify common diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight.
- Deep learning models: Implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.
- Dataset integration: Trained on publicly available datasets of potato leaf images.
- User-friendly workflow: Provides clear scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Scalable design: Can be extended to other crops or integrated into IoT-based monitoring systems.
