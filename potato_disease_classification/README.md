#Potato Disease Prediction 🌱🥔

This project focuses on detecting and classifying diseases in potato plants using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It aims to help farmers and agricultural enthusiasts identify plant diseases early, improving crop yield and reducing losses.

Key Features:

Detects multiple potato diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves.

Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate image-based classification.

Preprocessing pipeline includes image augmentation and normalization for better model performance.

Provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading images and predicting disease type.

Technologies & Tools:

Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV for image processing

NumPy & Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Dataset:

The project uses publicly available potato leaf datasets for training and testing.

Potential Improvements:

Expand to detect diseases in other crops.

Deploy as a web or mobile application for real-time use.

Integrate IoT sensors for environmental monitoring.
